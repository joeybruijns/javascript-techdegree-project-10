# Full Stack App with React and a REST API
## Project 10 | Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

In this project, we’ll use React to create a client for the existing school database REST API (that we created in a previous project). The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

For this project, we’ll use React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.
